## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing involves downloading the necessary datasets, parsing the data, vectorizing the text into integers, and formatting the data for training.

## Implement a Transformer

This section provides an overview of the Transformer architecture and describes the implementation of the custom transformer layer. The transformer architecture consists of 4 components:

1. Embedder
2. Positional Encoding
3. Encoder
4. Decoder

## Train the Model

This section describes how to train the model using the prepared data and the implemented transformer layer.

## Inference on New English Sentences

Finally, this section shows how to use the trained model to translate new English sentences to Spanish.

## Conclusion

This project shows how to use a custom transformer layer to translate English sentences to Spanish. The transformer layer was implemented and trained on the prepared dataset. Successful translation on new sentences into Spanish was achieved.
