# Demystifying Transformers: An Interactive Guide

This Jupyter notebook is your comprehensive, hands-on introduction to the Transformer architecture, a groundbreaking innovation in the world of natural language processing (NLP).

## Overview

Transformers have revolutionized how we handle tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question-answering. This notebook breaks down the core components of Transformers, guiding you through the intricacies of:

* **Attention Mechanisms:** Learn how Transformers selectively focus on different parts of input sequences, enabling a deeper understanding of relationships between words.
* **Self-Attention:** Explore the concept of self-attention, where a sequence attends to itself, uncovering hidden patterns and dependencies.
* **Encoder-Decoder Structure:** Understand how the encoder processes input sequences and the decoder generates output sequences, forming the foundation of many NLP applications.
* **Positional Encoding:** See how Transformers handle the order of words in a sequence, a crucial aspect for tasks like translation.
* **Multi-Head Attention:** Dive into the power of multi-head attention, which allows the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces simultaneously.
* **Feedforward Networks:** Discover the role of feedforward networks in processing and transforming the information captured by attention mechanisms.

## Prerequisites
